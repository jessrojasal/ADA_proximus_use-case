## **Code review**
- good readme
- code documentation could be improved (dosctrings, typing) because not consistent 
- archive not needed
- hardcoded api_key in gophish_engine/main.py
- very clear architecture and nice OOP logic
- I don't see anything about AWS EC2 so I assume you've done it manually, this is already excellent! To dive into more details you can have a look at aws-cdk to implement it programmatically using python. 
- This project is excellent :fire:

## **Presentation review**
- good overview of the workflow, very important
- useful, clean and meaningful campaign dashboard
- good prompt engineering explanations and emails generation 2 is interesting
- PowerBI dashboard is a nice bonus, a bit crowded but it was not the main goal so no problem
- explanations were very clear during the presentation
