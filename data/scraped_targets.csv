As a Project Manager @Proximus, I'm responsible for managing multiple design projects from inception to completion, ensuring that each project is delivered on time, within budget, and to the highest quality standards. Working closely with cross-functional teams, including designers, developers, and other stakeholders, I collaborate to plan, execute, and deliver design projects that exceed expectations.
Responsibilities are varied:
Identify and manage project risks, issues, and dependencies and develop contingency plans as needed. By anticipating potential challenges and developing mitigation strategies, I ensure that projects stay on track.
Manage communication and reporting with project stakeholders, including status updates, risks, issues, and key decisions. By fostering open lines of communication and providing timely updates, I ensure that all stakeholders are informed and engaged throughout the project lifecycle.
Foster a culture of teamwork, collaboration, and continuous improvement across the design team. By promoting a positive work environment and fostering collaboration, I ensure that team members are motivated and engaged in their work.
